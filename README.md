# Selenium Assignment Reminder Bot

This is a simple bot that crawls on the college online classes website, picks up the assignments pending for the day and
sends emails to the students who have opted for "Yes" in the [form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfBltXB26pI9EUmHDP-lrU0SxBKwoLQhy9nXVCnj9vqLmzdDQ/viewform?usp=sf_link).

This bot works for 2019 Batch only. So if you are from any other batch, you need to use your own username and password and 
store in your environment variables for your batch.
